## Sussex wide health inequalities work

This repository contains publicly available datasets and analyses to support the Sussex wide work on health inequalities; particularly for Primary Care Networks and the Directed Enhanced Services (DES) for Core20P:US5.

### Definitions

The ‘Core20PLUS5’ initiative is to drive targeted health inequalities improvements in the following areas:

_Core 20_ – Most deprived 20% of our population

_PLUS_ – Other population groups as identified by local population health data such as ethnic minority communities

_5_ – Targeting five key clinical areas of health inequalities:

- **Early Cancer diagnosis (screening & early referral)** 75% of cases diagnosed at stage 1 or 2 by 2028
- **Hypertension case finding** allowing for interventions to optimise blood pressure and minimise risk of myocardial infarction and stroke
- **Chronic Respiratory disease (driving Covid & Flu vaccination uptake)** a clear focus on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease driving up uptake of vaccines to reduce infective exacerbations and emergency hospital admissions resulting from these exacerbations
- **Annual health checks for people with Serious Mental Illness** 60% of those living with Severe Mental Illness (SMI) receiving annual health checks
- **Continuity of maternity carer plan** ensure continuity of care for 75% of women from Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities and from the most deprived groups.
