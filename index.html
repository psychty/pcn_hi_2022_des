  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>Life expectancy, nationally and in West Sussex, has increased in the last 20 years overall (Global Burden of Disease, 2019) but there is a gap of almost four years between males and females. Healthy life expectancy (the number of years an average person might expect to live in good, disease free, life) has also increased but the gain in healthy life expectancy has not been as high compared to gains in overall life expectancy. Similar to overall life expectancy, male healthy life expectancy trails behind females although the gap is much smaller at just over one years difference. Whilst females may live longer lives than males, in West Sussex and nationally, females tend to spend more of their lives living with disability or in 'sub-optimal' health, compared to males.</p>

  <p>Health inequalities are unfair and often avoidable differences in health across the population, and between different groups within society based on their sex (such as with life expectancy) but it can also arise from factors such as our age, race, sexual orientation, where we are born, work, and where we live. Indeed, the gap in life expectancy at birth between the most and least deprived areas in England overall is around nine years for males and almost eight years for females (Office for National Statistics, 2021). This means that <b>those living in the most deprived parts of the country could expect to die around eight or nine years earlier than those in the least deprived areas of England</b>. The gap in healthy life expectancy is doubled at around 19 years for males and females living in the least deprived areas compared to their counterparts in the most deprived areas.</p>

  <p>The extra years in sub-optimal health place even further pressure on health services as well as having an impact on employment and productivity. The additional costs to the NHS of health inequalities have been estimated at almost £5 billion per year from the greater use of hospital services by people in deprived areas alone (Asaria, Doran, & Cookson, 2016).</p> 
    
  <p>The approach to acting on health inequalities was established in the NHS Long Term Plan (NHS England, 2019 (1)), prior to the COVID-19 global pandemic and the rationale and urgency for this work has only increased in response to the burden resulting from the pandemic and as services recover. There has never been a more important moment to coordinate an effort to reduce the gap in health inequalities.</p>
  <p>High quality services on their own can reduce unwarranted variation in outcomes. However, they will not reduce inequalities at a population level unless they also identify (with partners) and give graduated and targetted support to populations in greatest need, who may not be using those services to the best effect.</p>
<h1>The Core20PLUS5 approach</h1>
<p>The ‘Core20PLUS5’ initiative is to drive targeted health inequalities improvements in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Core 20</b> – Most deprived 20% of our population</li>
  <li><b>PLUS</b> – Other population groups as identified by local population health data such as ethnic minority communities</li>
 <li><b>5</b> – Targeting five key clinical areas of health inequalities:</li>
 <ul><li><b>Early Cancer diagnosis (screening & early referral)</b> 75% of cases diagnosed at stage 1 or 2 by 2028</li>
  <li><b>Hypertension case finding</b> allowing for interventions to optimise blood pressure and minimise risk of myocardial infarction and stroke</li>
  <li><b>Chronic Respiratory disease (driving Covid & Flu vaccination uptake)</b> a clear focus on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease driving up uptake of vaccines to reduce infective exacerbations and emergency hospital admissions resulting from these exacerbations</li>
  <li><b>Annual health checks for people with Serious Mental Illness</b> 60% of those living with Severe Mental Illness (SMI) receiving annual health checks</li>
  <li><b>Continuity of maternity carer plan</b> ensure continuity of care for 75% of women from Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities and from the most deprived groups.</li>
 </ul></ul>

  <h1>Primary Care Networks</h1>
  <p>Primary Care Networks (PCNs) are networks of general practices which attempt to integrate primary care with secondary and community services, and bridge a gap between general practice and emerging Integrated Care Systems (Fisher, Thorlby, & Alderwick, 2019). Each PCN is made up a group of a number of GP practices forming a network that covers approximately 30,000 to 50,000 patients.</p>
  <p>Directed Enhanced Services (DES) are voluntary add-ons to the core GP contract to incentivise specific services. The specific DES requirements of PCNs are set out in the Network Contract DES Specification (NHS England, 2019 (2)).</p>
  <p>The map below shows the geographical footprint of West Sussex PCNs.</p>
<p>Each PCN boundary is made by aggregating Lower-layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) together. However, it should be noted that GP practices do not have geographical boundaries and more than one GP practice can operate in the same local area. Whilst the map is useful to understand roughly the local areas that each PCN may cover, for planning purposes, in reality these boundaries are not mutually exclusive (e.g. there is some crossover as patients may use GP services outside of their local areas).</p>
<p>We have assigned every LSOA in West Sussex to one PCN based on data from the number of residents in the LSOA registered to each GP practice and some GP practices operate in areas assigned to other PCNs (e.g. Horsham Collaborative practices in Horsham Central areas). PCN boundaries can transcend district and borough boundaries and some even cross into neighbouring counties.</p>
<p>Each GP practice in West Sussex is shown as a dot which is also coloured by the PCN (see the key under the map). Click on one of these dots to see more. Note that GP practices often have patients on their lists who may travel far, even out of the district or county, to use their services.</p>
<p class = 'good_to_know'>Some practices may be part of one PCN but physically located inside an area designated to a different PCN.</p>

<h3>Age structure of PCN registered populations</h3>
<p>NHS Digital publish the number of patients registered to individual organisations along side basic demographic information such as age and sex, in monthly snapshots available to the public. See the publication <a href = 'https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-tools-and-services/data-services/general-practice-data-hub/patients-registered-at-a-gp-practice'>Patients registered at a GP practice</a> for more details. Data at LSOA level is published quarterly in January, April, July, and October each year.</p>
<p>We have used the January 2022 snapshot which contains the full range of data to get a picture of the overall age/sex structure of each PCN (by aggregating individual organisation data) and later in the section on deprivation we use the LSOA data to summarise the core20 population.</p>

<section id = 'deprivation'>
  <h1>Deprivation in West Sussex</h1>
  <p>West Sussex overall is relatively less deprived, and is in the top 20% of least deprived local authorities in the country. However, a small number of neighbourhoods along the coast in Arun and in Crawley are among the most deprived neighbourhoods in England.</p>

  <h3>The indices of deprivation</h3>
  <p>The Indices of Deprivation are an area-based measure of relative levels of deprivation in small areas, (Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs), which contain approximately 1,500 people). It can be used to compare the deprivation across different areas, identify the most deprived areas within a larger geography (for example in the CCG), and to examine which domains of deprivation are more or less prominent in an area. The Indices cannot be used to quantify how deprived an area is (nor can it say by how much one area is more deprived than another), and there are different indices of deprivation for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland (so comparisons cannot be made across countries).</p>
  <p>The indices are published by the Department for Communities and Local Government every 3-4 years and are widely used, notably in funding allocations and targeting. The most recent update is the ID2019, released in October 2019. ID2019 is made up of seven domains of deprivation, although each domain is not given equal weighting. From these, an overall score of small area deprivation is calculated; these are then ranked from most deprived (1) to least deprived (32,844). It is important to note that the indices measure deprivation and not affluence (the least deprived area may not necessarily be the most affluent).</p>
  <p>Domains contributing to the overall Index of multiple deprivation:</p>
  <ul><li><b>Income</b> (22.5%)</li>
    <li><b>Employment</b> (22.5%)</li>
    <li><b>Health Deprivation and Disability</b> (13.5%)</li>
    <li><b>Education, Skills and Training</b> (13.5%)</li>
    <li><b>Crime</b> (9.3%)</li>
    <li><b>Barriers to Housing and Services</b> (9.3%)</li>
    <li><b>Living Environment</b> (9.3%)</li></ul>

    <p>The map below shows the variation in relative deprivation across the PCNs in West Sussex. The darker blue areas are amongst the most deprived neighbourhoods in England and the lighter yellow are the least deprived.</p>

    <p>Click on an area to find out more about the relative deprivation reanking and hich PCN it has been assigned to. You can also toggle displaying the small areas designated the most deprived 20% of neighbourhoods nationally. It may be easier to see these areas if you uncheck the other layers on the map using the check boxes in the top right corner of the map.</p>

    <div id="map_2_id"></div>
    <h3>Deprivation key (nationally ranked deciles)</h3>
    <div id = 'deprivation_key'></div>
    <p>You can see from this map that not all PCNs cover areas which are considered to be the 'Core20' deprived neighbourhoods (this is deciles 1 and 2, representing the 20% of most deprived neighbourhoods in England). <b>However</b>, it should be reiterated that the PCN boundaries are mutually exclusive for planning purposes only and do not take into account that some patients may be registered to a PCN and live outside of the designated area for that PCN.</p>
    <p>This is covered in more detail in the section below.</p>
   <h3>Deprivation at the PCN (and GP) level</h3> 
   <p>The number of patients registered to individual practices, plus some basic information about the residential location of patients (postcode data aggregated to LSOA), is available in the public domain, and we can use this to get an idea of the number of patients PCNs and individual practices have on their lists that reside in more or less deprived areas. LSOA data is not published as frequently as the monthly snapshots, and so the data in this section are from an extract taken in January 2022.</p>
   <p class = 'good_to_know'>Using the registered population data enables us to capture the Core20 population for any PCN regardless of whether the patient lives in West Sussex or somewhere else in England, rather than denoting a single geographical area to a PCN as we have done earlier in this report. However, as a relatively less deprived county, there are relative few local areas designated as being in the top 20% of deprived areas.</p>
   <p>Table 1 shows the number and proportion of patients in the West Sussex PCNs who are from the most deprived 20% of neighbourhoods in England. More than half of the PCNs in the county have less than 1% of their registered population living in the most deprived areas of England. <b>However, a small number of PCNs along the coast serve populations where more than one in ten patients live in a more deprived area.</b> In the Angmering Coppice Fitzalan (ACF) PCN, this rises to one in six patients.</p>
   <p>The table below is sorted by the proportion of patients living in the most deprived 20% of areas.</p>
   <h4>Table 1 - number of patients registered to West Sussex PCNs; patients living in the most deprived neighbourhoods; registered popoulation; January 2022</h4>
   <table id = 'table_1' style="margin-bottom: 20px">

  <p>The figure below shows the distribution of patients registered to PCNs by their residential deprivation quintile; with more dark blue areas denoting PCNs with a higher proportion of patients in the most deprived neighbourhoods in England and those with more orange represent patients living in less deprived areas. This figure has also been sorted by the proportion of patients living in the most deprived quintile.</p>
  <h4>Proportion of patients by deprivation quintile; West Sussex PCNs; registered population; January 2022</h4>
  <div id = 'stacked_pcn_quintiles_figure'></div>
  <h3>Deprivation key (nationally ranked quintiles)</h3>
  <div id = 'quintile_key'></div>
  <p>If an area has a fairly equal footprint of deprivation, that is to say it has about the same number of patients living in each of the five deprivation quintiles, then the coloured bars will be about the same size/length. This is the case for Angmering Coppice Fitzalan (PCN) which has the highest proportion of patients living in the most deprived 20% of neighbourhoods in England at around 18% (or one in every six patients registered to the PCN). According the the latest publicly available snapshot of registrations, three PCNs have no patients living in the most deprived areas of the country. Indeed, in East Grinstead PCN, almost three out of four patients expected to be living in the least deprived 20% of neighbourhoods in England.</p>
  <p class = 'good_to_know'>The Core20 population refers to the nationally ranked deprivation profile which compares all 32,844 local areas in England.</p>
  <p>Some practices within individual PCNs have an even greater proportion of patients living in deprived areas. Table 2 shows GP practices within each PCN. By default it shows Angmering Coppice Fitzalan (ACF) PCN, but you can use the drop down menu below to choose another network to display in the table.</p>

  <h1>Other community differences</h1>
  <p>The remainder of small area data (sub PCN level) in this report are presented at the level of Middle-Layer Super Output Area (MSOA) which covers a larger area than LSOAs. As MSOAs have a larger and consistent population size, it is easier to report on differences across areas in disease prevalence and mortality where the actual numbers of people with conditions or number of people dying will be relatively low which could cause issues of disclosure of identity as well as increase the level of uncertainty in estimates of difference.</p>

  <div class="good_to_know">
  <p>MSOAs are built up from smaller neighbourhing LSOAs and have an average population size of 7,200 residents and roughly 4,000 households (at the last census in 2011). MSOAs are often used in reporting of demographic and health related data at a granular level as the whole of England and Wales can be broken down into these small areas which have a reasonably consistent population size. However, the boundaries of MSOAs can sometimes be difficult to interpret, particularly for those more familiar with wards as a geography.</p>
  <p>The difficulty of using wards as a basis for small area differences is that ward boundaries change frequently and can cover a population varying from around 1,000 to 30,000 people.  </p>
  <p>The House of Commons Library (2019) derived a set of recognisable names for MSOAs based on the towns, villages and neighbourhoods that they cover. Whilst these are not the official names, we present these names alongside the MSOA code to aid interpretation of local areas.</p>
</div>
<p>The next map shows indicators for fuel poverty and unemployment, and you can toggle between these indicators using the buttons on the top right of the map.</p>
<p>The PCN boundaries are also overlayed, but note that PCN footprint boundaries are derived from LSOAs and as such one MSOA may be partially in multiple PCN footprints.</p>
<h4>Neighbourhood level (MSOA) fuel poverty and unemployment variation across the county</h4>

<div id="map_3_id"></div>
<p>Unemployment is measured as the proportion of working age population claiming an out of work benefit. More details about this indicator can be found at the <a href = 'https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/local-health/data#page/6/gid/1938133180/pat/402/par/E06000001/ati/3/are/E02002483/iid/93097/age/204/sex/4/cat/-1/ctp/-1/yrr/1/cid/4/tbm/1'>OHID definition page for unemployment</a>.</p>

<section id = 'disease_inequalities'>
<h1>Inequalities in disease prevalence and burden</h1>
<p>Data in this section were extracted from the Fingertips service (Office for Health Improvement & Disparities, 2022)</p>
<p class = 'good_to_know'>It should be noted that at small area level such as neighbourhoods (and even at county level for some conditions), the number of deaths or people with conditions can be relatively small and as such, any variation can have a big impact. We often group or pool the number of deaths over a longer time period (such as five years for MSOA based life expectancy estimates) and also look at confidence intervals of estimates when deciding if one areas is bigger/smaller or better/worse than another.</p>
<h4>Neighbourhood level (MSOA) life expectancy and mortality variation across the county</h4>
<div id="map_4_id"></div>

<p>The next map shows hospital admissions for all causes as well as for selected acute and chronic conditions. The values presented are indrectly standardised ratios of admissions per 100 registered patients (estimated). More details about this indicator can be found at the <a href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/local-health/data#page/6/gid/1938133184/pat/402/par/E06000001/ati/3/are/E02002483/iid/93227/age/1/sex/4/cat/-1/ctp/-1/yrr/5/cid/4/tbm/1">OHID definition page for emergency hospital admissions</a>.</p>
<div class = 'good_to_know'>
  <p>Emergency admissions can be due to a variety of causes such as high levels of injury within a population as well as poor management of chronic conditions within primary care. As such, the all cause indicator of emergency admissions should be viewed as an indication of the levels of unplanned secondary care use within a population and care should be taken when interpreting these results.</p>
  <p>Indirect standardisation uses the number of admissions for England overall by age group and calculates an expected number of admissions for each area given its age demographic distribution. The ratio then describes the difference between the actual and expected number of admissions.</p>
