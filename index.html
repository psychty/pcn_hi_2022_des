<h2>An analysis to support the Core20PLUS5 Directed Enhanced Services programme in West Sussex.</h2>
<p>This analyses brings together publicly available datsets to support work on health inequalities, particularly for Primary Care Networks (PCNs) and the Directed Enhanced Services (DES) for Core20PLUS5. Many of the datasets are reproduced here under the terms of the Open Government Licence v.3.0. Other data sources are specified throughtout the report.</p>
<p class = 'good_to_know'>Note: this page is not currently accessibility friendly, due to some of the interactive elements on some figures and the maps. We are working to create a print and screen reader friendly version of the site as soon as possible. If you need help with any part of the analyses below, please email jsna[at]westsussex.gov.uk</p>

  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Life expectancy, nationally and in West Sussex, has increased in the last 20 years overall (Global Burden of Disease, 2019) but there is a gap of almost four years between males and females. However, whilst females may live longer lives than males, females tend to spend more of their lives living with disability or in 'sub-optimal' health, compared to males.</p>
  <p>Those living in the most deprived parts of the country could expect to <b>die around eight or nine years earlier </b>than those in the least deprived areas of England. The gap in healthy life expectancy is doubled at around 19 years for males and females living in the least deprived areas compared to their counterparts in the most deprived areas.</p>
  <p>The extra years in sub-optimal health place even further pressure on health services as well as having an impact on employment and productivity. The additional costs to the NHS of health inequalities have been estimated at almost £5 billion per year from the greater use of hospital services by people in deprived areas alone (Asaria, Doran, & Cookson, 2016).</p>
    
  <p>Health inequalities are unfair and often avoidable differences in health across the population, and between different groups within society based on their sex (such as with life expectancy) but it can also arise from factors such as our age, race, sexual orientation, where we are born, work, and where we live. Indeed, the gap in life expectancy at birth between the most and least deprived areas in England overall is around nine years for males and almost eight years for females (Office for National Statistics, 2021).</p>
  <p>High quality services on their own can reduce unwarranted variation in outcomes. However, they will not reduce inequalities at a population level unless they also identify (with partners) and give graduated and targetted support to populations in greatest need, who may not be using those services to the best effect.</p>

  <p>The approach to acting on health inequalities was established in the NHS Long Term Plan (NHS England, 2019 (1)), prior to the COVID-19 global pandemic and the rationale and urgency for this work has only increased in response to the burden resulting from the pandemic and as services recover. There has never been a more important moment to coordinate an effort to reduce the gap in health inequalities.</p>
  
<h1>The Core20PLUS5 approach</h1>
<p>The ‘Core20PLUS5’ initiative is to drive targeted health inequalities improvements in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Core 20</b> – Most deprived 20% of our population</li>
  <li><b>PLUS</b> – Other population groups as identified by local population health data such as ethnic minority communities</li>
 <li><b>5</b> – Targeting five key clinical areas of health inequalities:</li>
 <ul><li><b>Early Cancer diagnosis (screening & early referral)</b> 75% of cases diagnosed at stage 1 or 2 by 2028</li>
  <li><b>Hypertension case finding</b> allowing for interventions to optimise blood pressure and minimise risk of myocardial infarction and stroke</li>
  <li><b>Chronic Respiratory disease (driving Covid & Flu vaccination uptake)</b> a clear focus on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease driving up uptake of vaccines to reduce infective exacerbations and emergency hospital admissions resulting from these exacerbations</li>
  <li><b>Annual health checks for people with Serious Mental Illness</b> 60% of those living with Severe Mental Illness (SMI) receiving annual health checks</li>
  <li><b>Continuity of maternity carer plan</b> ensure continuity of care for 75% of women from Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities and from the most deprived groups.</li>
 </ul></ul>

<section id = 'primary_care_networks'>
  <h1>Primary Care Networks</h1>
  <p>Primary Care Networks (PCNs) are networks of general practices which attempt to integrate primary care with secondary and community services, and bridge a gap between general practice and emerging Integrated Care Systems (Fisher, Thorlby, & Alderwick, 2019). Each PCN is made up a group of a number of GP practices forming a network that covers approximately 30,000 to 50,000 patients.</p>
  <p>Directed Enhanced Services (DES) are voluntary add-ons to the core GP contract to incentivise specific services. The specific DES requirements of PCNs are set out in the Network Contract DES Specification (NHS England, 2019 (2)).</p>
  <p>The map below shows the geographical footprint of West Sussex PCNs.</p>
<p>Each PCN boundary is made by aggregating Lower-layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) together. However, it should be noted that GP practices do not have geographical boundaries and more than one GP practice can operate in the same local area. Whilst the map is useful to understand roughly the local areas that each PCN may cover, for planning purposes, in reality these boundaries are not mutually exclusive (e.g. there is some crossover as patients may use GP services outside of their local areas).</p>
<p>We have assigned every LSOA in West Sussex to one PCN based on data from the number of residents in the LSOA registered to each GP practice and some GP practices operate in areas assigned to other PCNs (e.g. Horsham Collaborative practices in Horsham Central areas). PCN boundaries can transcend district and borough boundaries and some even cross into neighbouring counties.</p>
<p>Each GP practice in West Sussex is shown as a dot which is also coloured by the PCN (see the key under the map). Click on one of these dots to see more. Note that GP practices often have patients on their lists who may travel far, even out of the district or county, to use their services. Some practices may be part of one PCN but physically located inside an area designated to a different PCN.</p>

</section>

<section id = 'pyramid' style = 'padding-top: 5vh;'>
<h3>Age structure of PCN registered populations</h3>
<p>Different PCNs across the county have markedly different populations. For example, almost one in three patients registered to Arun Integrated Care (AIC) PCN are aged 65 and over whilst South Crawley PCN provide services for a relative younger cohort of patients with just one in ten patients being aver the age of 65.</p>
<p>NHS Digital publish the number of patients registered to individual organisations along side basic demographic information such as age and sex, in monthly snapshots. See the publication <a href = 'https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-tools-and-services/data-services/general-practice-data-hub/patients-registered-at-a-gp-practice'>Patients registered at a GP practice</a> for more details. Data at LSOA level is published quarterly in January, April, July, and October each year.</p>
<p>We have used the January 2022 snapshot which contains the full range of data to get a picture of the overall age/sex structure of each PCN (by aggregating individual organisation data) and later in the section on deprivation we use the LSOA data to summarise the core20 population.</p>
<p>Use the drop down menu here to choose a PCN to find out more information about its age and sex population structure.</p>

<section id = 'deprivation'>
  <h1>Deprivation in West Sussex</h1>
  <p>West Sussex overall is relatively less deprived, and is in the top 20% of least deprived local authorities in the country. However, a small number of neighbourhoods along the coast in Arun and in Crawley are among the most deprived neighbourhoods in England.</p>

  <h3>The indices of deprivation</h3>
  <p>The Indices of Deprivation are an area-based measure of relative levels of deprivation in small areas, (Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs), which contain approximately 1,500 people). It can be used to compare the deprivation across different areas, identify the most deprived areas within a larger geography (for example in the CCG), and to examine which domains of deprivation are more or less prominent in an area. There are seven domains (income, employment, health and disability, education, crime, barriers to services and living environments).</p>
  <p>The indices are published by the Department for Communities and Local Government every 3-4 years and are widely used, notably in funding allocations and targeting. The most recent update is the ID2019, released in October 2019. An overall score of small area deprivation is calculated from the measures in the seven domains; these are then ranked from most deprived (1) to least deprived (32,844). It is important to note that the indices measure deprivation and not affluence (the least deprived area may not necessarily be the most affluent) and the scores/ranks cannot be used to quantify how deprived an area is (nor can it say by how much one area is more deprived than another).</p>
  <!-- <p>Domains contributing to the overall Index of multiple deprivation:</p>
  <ul><li><b>Income</b> (22.5%)</li>
    <li><b>Employment</b> (22.5%)</li>
    <li><b>Health Deprivation and Disability</b> (13.5%)</li>
    <li><b>Education, Skills and Training</b> (13.5%)</li>
    <li><b>Crime</b> (9.3%)</li>
    <li><b>Barriers to Housing and Services</b> (9.3%)</li>
    <li><b>Living Environment</b> (9.3%)</li></ul> -->

    <p>The map below shows the variation in relative deprivation across the PCNs in West Sussex. The darker blue areas are amongst the most deprived neighbourhoods in England and the lighter yellow are the least deprived.</p>

    <p>Click on an area to find out more about the relative deprivation reanking and hich PCN it has been assigned to. You can also toggle displaying the small areas designated the most deprived 20% of neighbourhoods nationally. It may be easier to see these areas if you uncheck the other layers on the map using the check boxes in the top right corner of the map.</p>

    <h3>Deprivation key (nationally ranked deciles)</h3>
    <div id = 'deprivation_key'></div>
    <p>You can see from this map that not all PCNs cover areas which are considered to be the 'Core20' deprived neighbourhoods (this is deciles 1 and 2, representing the 20% of most deprived neighbourhoods in England). However, it should be reiterated that the PCN boundaries are mutually exclusive for planning purposes only and do not take into account that some patients may be registered to a PCN and live outside of the designated area for that PCN.</p>
    <p>This is covered in more detail in the section below.</p>
   <h3>Deprivation at the PCN (and GP) level</h3> 
   <p>The number of patients registered to individual practices, plus some basic information about the residential location of patients (postcode data aggregated to LSOA), is available in the public domain, and we can use this to get an idea of the number of patients PCNs and individual practices have on their lists that reside in more or less deprived areas. LSOA data is not published as frequently as the monthly snapshots, and so the data in this section are from an extract taken in January 2022.</p>
   <p class = 'good_to_know'>Using the registered population data enables us to capture the Core20 population for any PCN regardless of whether the patient lives in West Sussex or somewhere else in England, rather than denoting a single geographical area to a PCN as we have done earlier in this report. However, as a relatively less deprived county, there are relative few local areas designated as being in the top 20% of deprived areas.</p>
   <p>Table 1 shows the number and proportion of patients in the West Sussex PCNs who are from the most deprived 20% of neighbourhoods in England. More than half of the PCNs in the county have less than 1% of their registered population living in the most deprived areas of England. <b>However, a small number of PCNs along the coast serve populations where more than one in ten patients live in a more deprived area.</b> In the Angmering Coppice Fitzalan (ACF) PCN, this rises to one in six patients.</p>
   <p>The table below is sorted by the proportion of patients living in the most deprived 20% of areas.</p>
   <h4>Table 1 - number of patients registered to West Sussex PCNs; patients living in the most deprived neighbourhoods; registered popoulation; January 2022</h4>
   <table id = 'table_1' style="margin-bottom: 20px">

  <p>The figure below shows the distribution of patients registered to PCNs by their residential deprivation quintile; with more dark blue areas denoting PCNs with a higher proportion of patients in the most deprived neighbourhoods in England and those with more orange represent patients living in less deprived areas. This figure has also been sorted by the proportion of patients living in the most deprived quintile.</p>
  <h4>Proportion of patients by deprivation quintile; West Sussex PCNs; registered population; January 2022</h4>
  <div id = 'stacked_pcn_quintiles_figure'></div>
  <h3>Deprivation key (nationally ranked quintiles)</h3>
  <div id = 'quintile_key'></div>
  <p>If an area has a fairly equal footprint of deprivation, that is to say it has about the same number of patients living in each of the five deprivation quintiles, then the coloured bars will be about the same size/length. This is the case for Angmering Coppice Fitzalan (PCN) which has the highest proportion of patients living in the most deprived 20% of neighbourhoods in England at around 18% (or one in every six patients registered to the PCN). According the the latest publicly available snapshot of registrations, three PCNs have no patients living in the most deprived areas of the country. Indeed, in East Grinstead PCN, almost three out of four patients expected to be living in the least deprived 20% of neighbourhoods in England.</p>
  <p class = 'good_to_know'>The Core20 population refers to the nationally ranked deprivation profile which compares all 32,844 local areas in England.</p>
  <p>Some practices within individual PCNs have an even greater proportion of patients living in deprived areas. Table 2 shows GP practices within each PCN. By default it shows Angmering Coppice Fitzalan (ACF) PCN, but you can use the drop down menu below to choose another network to display in the table.</p>

  <h1>Other community differences</h1>
  <p>In this section we explore other publicly available datasets on small areas for wider determinents of health including income deprivation related to fuel poverty, unemployment, and ethnicity.</p>
  <p>For most indicators we have used the Local Health profiles published by the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (OHID, formerly Public Health England). However, for Fuel Poverty, a more recent time period of data is available from another source.</p>

  <p>Local Health outputs are usually at the level of Middle-Layer Super Output Area (MSOA) which covers a larger area than LSOAs. As MSOAs have a larger and consistent population size, it is easier to report on differences across areas in disease prevalence and mortality where the actual numbers of people with conditions or number of people dying will be relatively low which could cause issues of disclosure of identity as well as increase the level of uncertainty in estimates of difference.</p>

  <div class="good_to_know">
  <p>MSOAs are built up from smaller neighbourhing LSOAs and have an average population size of 7,200 residents and roughly 4,000 households (at the last census in 2011). MSOAs are often used in reporting of demographic and health related data at a granular level as the whole of England and Wales can be broken down into these small areas which have a reasonably consistent population size. However, the boundaries of MSOAs can sometimes be difficult to interpret, particularly for those more familiar with wards as a geography.</p>
  <p>The difficulty of using wards as a basis for small area differences is that ward boundaries change frequently and can cover a population varying from around 1,000 to 30,000 people.  </p>
  <p>The House of Commons Library (2019) derived a set of recognisable names for MSOAs based on the towns, villages and neighbourhoods that they cover. Whilst these are not the official names, we present these names alongside the MSOA code to aid interpretation of local areas.</p>
</div>

 <h4>Ethnicity</h4>
 <p>This indicator shows the number of people stating their ethnicity as "not White" in the 2011 Census, as per census ethnicity description as a percentage of the total number of respondents to the census question. The population whose ethnicity is not White has continued to increase from the 2001 to the 2011 Census, in terms of number and proportion, in most areas in England.</p>
 <p>The PCN boundaries are also overlayed, but note that PCN footprint boundaries are derived from LSOAs and as such one MSOA may be partially in multiple PCN footprints.</p>


<h4>Neighbourhood level (MSOA) ethnicity variation across the county</h4>
<div id="map_3a_id"></div>
<p>As you can see from the map, in 2011, the majority of neighbourhoods across West Sussex had less than 5% reporting their ethnicity as non-White. However, in a few coastal towns and in Crawley, there were much higher proportions of neighbourhood populations giving Black and other Minority Ethnicity group responses.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the MSOA covering Langley Green and Gatwick Airport in Crawley, two in five people said their ethinicity was non-White.</p>

 <div class="good_to_know">
   <p>For some indicators such as ethnicity, the census is the best and most up to date source of information available to us. However, the England and Wales census is carried out once every 10 years. Whilst there was a census in 2021, it takes a long time for small area outputs to become publicly available and so we currently rely on information from the 2011 census which is likely to be out of date.</p>
   <p>The first results from the 2021 census are expected to be released in the summer of 2022, with the remainder expected in the following year.</p>
 </div>
 
 <h4>Fuel poverty</h4>
  <p>In 2021 (data for 2019 onwards) the small area fuel poverty indicators changed from a low income high cost measure (where a household is fuel poor if they have required fuel costs that are above the national median level, and were they to spend that amount, they would be left with a residual income below the official poverty line) to a low income, low energy efficiency measure in which a household is fuel poor if:</p>
  <ul><li>The household lives in a property with an energy efficiency rating of band D, E, F or G</li><li>AND its disposable income (after housing costs and energy needs) would place them below the poverty line)</li></ul> 
  <p>Fuel poverty is distinct from general poverty as not all poor households are fuel poor, and some households would not normally be considered poor but could be pushed into fuel poverty if they have high energy costs.</p>
  <h4>Neighbourhood level (LSOA) fuel poverty varuation across the county; 2020 data</h4>
  <div id="map_3b_id"></div>
  <p>Data for this indicator come from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). More details about this indicator can be found at the <a href = 'hhttps://www.gov.uk/government/collections/fuel-poverty-statistics'>fuel poverty statistics website</a></p>
  <p>This indicator shows that whilst some coastal neighbourhoods across West Sussex have a high proportion of households estimated to be in fuel poverty as we might expect given overall neighbourhood deprivation in these areas, there are particular areas in the rural north of Chichester and Horsham which are estimated to have more than one in ten households in fuel poverty.</p>

<p>The next map shows indicators for unemployment. You can toggle between the proportion of 16-64 year olds claiming benefit primarily for the reason of being unemployed and the rate of 16-64 year olds who have been claiming Jobseeker's Allowance for a period of more than one year.</p>

<h4>Neighbourhood level (MSOA) unemployment variation across the county</h4>
<div id="map_3c_id"></div>
<p>Unemployment is measured as the proportion of working age population claiming an out of work benefit. More details about this indicator can be found at the <a href = 'https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/local-health/data#page/6/gid/1938133180/pat/402/par/E06000001/ati/3/are/E02002483/iid/93097/age/204/sex/4/cat/-1/ctp/-1/yrr/1/cid/4/tbm/1'>OHID definition page for unemployment</a>.</p>

<section id = 'qof'>
<h1>Inequalities in recorded disease prevalence and burden</h1>
 
<p>The Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) is a voluntary reward and incentive programme for all GP practices in England, detailing achievement in four domains. The four domains are: Clinical; Public Health and Public Health – Additional Services and Quality Improvement. Each domain consists of a set of achievement measures, known as indicators, against which practices score points according to their level of achievement. As part of this, practices are asked to maintain patient registers for certain conditions. This is one of the best tools we have available to us to understand differences in prevalence of disease across areas/providers.</p>
<p class = 'good_to_know'>Note that QOF prevalence is based on disease registers and not all patients with the same conditions present in the same way, and using QOF assumes that all those with the condition are engaged with their GP practice. We know that some groups (such as, but not limited to, those in deprived areas, those from Black and Minority Ethnicity (BAME) groups, and those with no fixed abode) are less likely to present to their GP with health problems. As such, disease registers can often under represent the true prevalence of conditions.</p>

<p>The QOF includes cardiovascular conditions such as hypertension and heart failure, respiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, musculoskeletal conditions such as osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis, high dependency or long term conditions such as cancer, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease, and mental health/neurology conditions such as depression, dementia, epilepsy and learning disabilities.</p>

<p>As data are provided at the GP practice level, we are able to aggregate these to PCN level to compare across areas and with West Sussex overall and against national prevalence too. To do this we present the prevalence values along with confidence intervals (see the box below for an explanation on why confidence intervals are useful).</p>
<p>The first figure below shows all providers/areas for each condition. By default the figure shows asthma prevalence but this can be changed using the drop down menu below. From this you can see how recorded prevalence for each condition varies across West Sussex.</p>

<h4 id = 'qof_1_title'></h4>

<select id="select_qof_1_condition"></select>
<div id = qof_1_datavis></div>

<div class = 'good_to_know'>
  <p>The red lines on the top of each bar are an indication of the confidence interval/limits for the prevalence estimate. This is a measure of the uncertainty of an estimate and it allows us to quantify the range in which we could expect the true value to be if we measured the same thing over and over again in the population. It is useful for considering differences across different areas or over time.</p> 
  <p>We tend to say that if two areas/cohorts or bars have a non-overlapping confidence interval, then they are statistically significantly different. For many conditions, where patient numbers are relative low, adjascent areas often have overlapping confidence intervals, showing that they may have a similar prevalence.</p>
  <p>For asthma, the bottom eight PCNs have overlapping confidence intervals and may not be different to the national prevalence (in black bars). For atrial fibrilation however, it is clear that South Crawley PCN has a significantly lower prevalence compared to Crawley Care Collaborative PCN.</p>
  </div>

<p>The second figure allows you to compare individual providers against other areas or nationally against all conditions at once. Choose area one (Angmering Coppice Fitzalan (ACF) PCN by default) and a comparator area (England by default). Hover over a bar to find out more.</p>

<p class = 'good_to_know'>It should be noted that at small area level such as neighbourhoods (and even at county level for some conditions), the number of deaths or people with conditions can be relatively small and as such, any variation can have a big impact.

  <h3>Life expectancy at birth</h3>
 <p>Life expectancy is an estimate of the average number of years a new-born baby would survive if he or she experienced the age-specific mortality rates for that area and time period throughout his or her life. Life expectancy at birth is a useful summary measure of all-cause mortality as it quantifies the differences between areas in units (years of life) that are fairly readily understood and meaningful. Differences in health expectancies reflect health inequalities between different population groups such as between males and females, social classes and ethnic groups. Life expectancy at birth is calculated separately for males and females.</p>
<p>Males born in West Sussex can expect to live, on average, <b>80.7 years</b>. This is <b>3.4 years</b> lower than the life expectancy at birth for females in the county (<b>84.2 years</b>). Compared to England overall, life expectancy at birth is around one year higher in West Sussex, and this is for both males and females. However, there is a lot of variation in life expectancy across smaller areas in the county.</p>
<p>Indeed, the gap in male life expectancy between the highest neighbourhood (West Chiltington Common in Horsham, 86.7 years) and the lowest (Littlehampton West and River in Arun, 72.5 years) is 14.2 years. Females born in the highest life expectancy neighbourhood (Maidenbower East and Worth in Crawley, 91.5 years) can expect to live, on average, 14.5 years longer than females born in the lowest life expectancy neighbourhood (Bognor Regis Central in Arun, 77 years).</p>

<section id = 'hospital'>
<p>The next map shows hospital admissions for all causes as well as for selected acute and chronic conditions. The values presented are indrectly standardised ratios of admissions per 100 registered patients (estimated). More details about this indicator can be found at the <a href="https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/local-health/data#page/6/gid/1938133184/pat/402/par/E06000001/ati/3/are/E02002483/iid/93227/age/1/sex/4/cat/-1/ctp/-1/yrr/5/cid/4/tbm/1">OHID definition page for emergency hospital admissions</a>.</p>
<div class = 'good_to_know'>
  <p>Emergency admissions can be due to a variety of causes such as high levels of injury within a population as well as poor management of chronic conditions within primary care. As such, the all cause indicator of emergency admissions should be viewed as an indication of the levels of unplanned secondary care use within a population and care should be taken when interpreting these results.</p>
  <p>Indirect standardisation uses the number of admissions for England overall by age group and calculates an expected number of admissions for each area given its age demographic distribution. The ratio then describes the difference between the actual and expected number of admissions.</p>

 <h1>CVDPREVENT</h1>
 <p>CVDPREVENT is a national primary care audit extracting routinely held primary care data from almost 80% of GP practices in England on the diagnosis and management of six high risk conditions and is part of an NHS Long Term Plan ambition to prevent 150,000 strokes and heart attacks over the next ten years by improving the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure), Hypercholesterolaemia (high cholesterol) and atrial fibrillation (AF).</p>
 <p>The audit attempts to identify whether people with high risk conditions are being identified, diagnosed, and managed to NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) guidance. Over time, more indicators will become available and each iteration of an annual CVDPREVENT report will contain a different focus. In 2021, the first CVDPREVENT report detailed a pre-pandemic baseline of prevalence and clinical indicators. Further analyses of identifying those at risk and with conditions (different to recorded diagnoses) will be available some time later in 2022.</p>

 <div class="good_to_know">
 <p>In contrast to the QOF recorded prevalence of diseases outlined in the <a href = '#qof'>QOF section</a> above, the CVDPREVENT audit enables the consideration of age, sex, ethnicity, and deprivation inequalities in these conditions. However, ethnicity is not always well recorded, with around 20% of records missing ethnicity information. Moreover, prevalence of these conditions by ethnicity are not available in the current release from CVDPREVENT although we expect more detail to become available in future releases.</p>
 <p>The CVDPREVENT audit is a sample study, and currently represents 80% of GP practices in England, with variation in uptake across the country. It is expected that over time, more practices will contribute data to this programme.</p>
 <p><b>Recorded prevalence is currently only available for Clinical Commissioning Group</b> geographies, however it useful to explore how the local prevealence of diagnosed conditions is impacted by these demographic factors. We are currently able to explore prevalence of atrial fibrilation, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease by age, sex, and separately by deprivation quintiles. As soon as more granular level data becomes available, such as at PCN level, we will add it to these analyses.</p>
 <!-- <p>There are also differences in time periods of data extraction between the QOF and the CVDPREVENT audit.</p> -->

<h3>A closer look at Atrial fibrilation (AF)</h3>
<p>Atrial fibrilation is a rhythm disorder which can increase risk of stroke. In England, as at September 2021, 2.3% of over 18's included in the audit had a recorded diagnosis of atrial_fibrilation. In West Sussex, prevalence is significantly higher than the national prevalence at 2.9% (around 21,000 adults). These are slightly higher than in the QOF prevalence for 2020/21 although as noted there are difference is time period as well as the population covered as QOF is for all ages and the audit is for those aged 18 and over.</p>

<p>The table below shows that as at September 2021, there were almost 21,000 adults across West Sussex primary care with a recorded diagnosis of atrial fibrilation. Prevalence amongst 18-39 year olds is around 0.1% or 1 per 1,000 people. Among 40-59 year olds, the prevalence of atrial fibrilation is around 0.6% (about 1 in 200 people). In West Sussex, more than twice as many males aged 40-59 (1,110 compared to 425) had a diagnosis of atrial fibrilation than females; moreover, the prevalence among males in West Sussex (0.9%) is significantly higher than for males in England (0.8%).</p>

<p class = 'caption'>The prevalence among each age group is given in the brackets alongside 95% confidence intervals of estimates. Numbers of patients are rounded to the nearest five, and small counts (1-7 patients) are supressed.</p>

<p>The CVDPREVENT report currently shows prevalence by age and sex, and separately for deprivation quintile (shown in the figure below). At present, prevalence estimates are not available by ethnicity although the 2021 audit report highlighted nationally that those in Black, Asian and ethinc minority groups were clear targets for improving the management of AF.</p>

<p>The figure below shows the prevalence of recorded atrial fibrilation among those aged 18 and over by deprivation quintile. This shows that there is variation in prevalence depending on where someone lives. At first glance, the pattern is clear on the right hand side for England overall that recorded prevalence tends to be higher among those living in less deprived areas. The pattern is less clear at more local areas such as at the CCG level (and there are wider confidence intervals at smaller areas, denoted by the red lines at the top of each bar). That prevalence is higher amongst those living in less deprived areas is surprising given other population studies in academic research such as <a href = 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666776221001344?via%3Dihub'>Chung et al. 2021</a> which suggest the risk of developing atrial fibrilation and having poorer outcomes (such as death) are highest in more deprived areas.</p>

<p>The CVDPREVENT authors explain that given areas of higher deprivation usually have a younger age profile, it is possible that the higher prevalence in less deprived areas is because there are more older people in these areas. The authors used age-adjusted synthetic modelling to account for this and indicate that there are almost no differences across the deprivation quintiles when age is controlled. These synthetic estimates are not currently available in the public domain but we hope that future iterations of the CVDPREVENT audit will publish these.</p>

<h4>Recorded prevalence of atrial fibrilation by neighbourhood deprivation quintile; patients aged 18+; Sussex CCGs, STP, and England; to September 2021</h4>
<div id = 'af_cvd_prevent_deprivation_vis'></div>

<div class = 'good_to_know'>
  <p>The red lines on the top of each bar are an indication of the confidence interval/limits for the prevalence estimate. This is a measure of the uncertainty of an estimate and it allows us to quantify the range in which we could expect the true value to be if we measured the same thing over and over again in the population. It is useful for considering differences across different areas or over time.</p> 
  <p>We tend to say that if two areas/cohorts or bars have a non-overlapping confidence interval, then they are statistically significantly different. This is the case for the most deprived quintile and quintle 2 in NHS East Sussex CCG on the figure above. When the confidence limits overlap, as in the most deprived quintile and quintile 2 for NHS West Sussex CCG, we tend to say these two cohorts are statistically similar, even though it looks like quintile 2 has a higher prevalence.</p>
  <p>With more people in a population, the interval tends to be smaller, which is why the STP and national bars have much smaller red lines.</p>
  </div>

<h4>Treatment for high risk patients</h4>
<p>Antigoaculation therapy treatments (using drugs) are given to people at high risk of getting blood clots to reduce the chance of cardioascular events such as strokes. The CHA2DS2-VASc is a screening tool that can be used to identify patients with atrial fibrilation who are high risk for having a stroke; with <a href = 'https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng196'>NICE guidance for atrial fibrilation diagnosis and management</a> indicating that those with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 or higher should be offered antigoaculation treatment after considering the benefits and risks of bleeding.</p>

<p>Across NHS West Sussex CCG, <b>17,105 patients</b> (based on the denominator for the anticoagulant prescription indicator) had a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 or more placing them <b>at high risk of stroke</b>. This is more than four out of every five patients (81.4% of the 21,000 patients with a recorded diagnosis of atrial fibrilation).</p>

<p>Nationally, according to the CVDPRVENT audit covering the period to September 2021, 88.2% of patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 or more had a recorded prescription of an anticoagulant drug in the previous six months. In West Sussex, this is 86.3% and this is statistically significantly lower than the national prescription rate.</p>

<p>Whilst prevalence is not currently available at PCN level, the anticoagulant prescription rate is, and so the figure below shows the variation in recent anticoagulant prescription for those atrial fibrilation patients scoring high risk for stroke across West Sussex.</p>

 <h3>A closer look at hypertension</h1>
 <p>Hypertension, persistently raised blood pressure, is a major risk factor for cardioascular diseases such as heart failure, stroke, heart attack (myocardial infarction) as well as chronic kidney disease, and dementia, and is widely linked to premature mortality. Hypertension is also one of the most treatable conditions</p>
 <p>The cardioascular disease (CVD) prevention programme sets a 10 year ambition for hypertension that 80% of the total number of people receiving a diagnosis are treated to target.</p>
 <p>Nationally, two in five people with recorded hypertension also had a record of obesity and with obesity also linked to deprivation there is a marked opportunity to reduce CVD risk.</p>
